<Colour Picker> revolves around the desire to group fishes based on their appearance. So the field <colour> comes in mind. The dominant colour within the image of the fish is reduced to a single hex code, which in turn visualised into a colour map - in a form of a bubble diagram forming a silhouette of a fish. The colour of the fishes is arranged and interpolated a gradient within the visulisation. Upon hovering over the colour of interest, a quick window pops up and display the % of the prevalence of fishes of such colour and upon clicking it, a window appears and blurs the background, showing fishes of the similar colours. The results can be altered by changing the hexcode, hence changing the colours of interest which will yield different set of results.
