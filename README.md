Colour Picker concept revolves around the desire to group fishes based on their appearance. So the field, colour, comes in mind. The dominant colour within the image of the fish is reduced to a single hex code, which in turn visualised into a colour map - in a form of a bubble diagram forming a silhouette of a fish. The colour of the fishes is arranged and interpolated a gradient within the visulisation. Upon hovering over the colour of interest, a quick window pops up and display the % of the prevalence of fishes of such colour and upon clicking it, a window appears and blurs the background, showing fishes of the similar colours. The results can be altered by changing the hexcode, hence changing the colours of interest which will yield different set of results.

Translator concept comes from the need to simplify scientific names to make the data more accessible to the general public. The scientific names and location data are parsed while creating a function to group and convert these set of scientific terms to the layman nouns we are familiar with. ie. "Carcharodon carcharias" to "Shark". The results are then visualised in a tree diagram, with the location being the parent category, followed by the archetypes of the fishes being a secondary category. The diagram goes to show the proportion of species within each ocean/sea and species of fishes specific(or not) to that region. Upon clicking the ocean, it enlarges to show a more specific treemap divided by the archetypes of the fishes found in that specific ocean/sea. In this situation hovering over each fragent of the secondary treemap allows a glance of the data about to be presented if further clicks are done, such as % of its population within that said ocean and its archetype - predator etc..

Lost Community was derived from the continuation of the project of grouping fishes via depths. While various fishes live in various depths, there is a huge chance that some live in similar / same depth. This tool allows us to visualise clusters of fishes and ultimately, habitat within the same depth, gathering potential underwater communities previously unimagined, like a population density of fishes in the ocean. In a form of a heat map, it show depths that are "popular" amongst fishes. Upon clicking the clusters, the fishes that are found in that depth are shown.
