Colour Picker concept revolves around the desire to group fishes based on their appearance. So the field, colour, comes in mind. The dominant colour within the image of the fish is reduced to a single hex code, which in turn visualised into a colour map - in a form of a bubble diagram forming a silhouette of a fish. The colour of the fishes is arranged and interpolated a gradient within the visulisation. Upon hovering over the colour of interest, a quick window pops up and display the % of the prevalence of fishes of such colour and upon clicking it, a window appears and blurs the background, showing fishes of the similar colours. The results can be altered by changing the hexcode, hence changing the colours of interest which will yield different set of results.

Translator concept comes from the need to simplify scientific names to make the data more accessible to the general public. The scientific names and location data are parsed while creating a function to group and convert these set of scientific terms to the layman nouns we are familiar with. ie. "Carcharodon carcharias" to "Shark". The results are then visualised in a tree diagram, with the location being the parent category, followed by the archetypes of the fishes being a secondary category. The diagram goes to show the proportion of species within each ocean/sea and species of fishes specific(or not) to that region. Upon clicking the ocean, it enlarges to show a more specific treemap divided by the archetypes of the fishes found in that specific ocean/sea. In this situation hovering over each fragent of the secondary treemap allows a glance of the data about to be presented if further clicks are done, such as % of its population within that said ocean and its archetype - predator etc..

Lost Community was derived from the continuation of the project of grouping fishes via depths. While various fishes live in various depths, there is a huge chance that some live in similar / same depth. This tool allows us to visualise clusters of fishes and ultimately, habitat within the same depth, gathering potential underwater communities previously unimagined, like a population density of fishes in the ocean. In a form of a heat map, it show depths that are "popular" amongst fishes. Upon clicking the clusters, the fishes that are found in that depth are shown.

Coloring the Taxonomy

In this visualization, the core structure is based on taxonomic classification, where the hierarchy follows standard taxonomic levels such as Class, Order, and Family. However, I have used color-coding to represent the ecological rolesof each species (e.g., predator, herbivore, omnivore). This approach emphasizes that even within the same Class, multiple ecological roles coexist. By combining the taxonomic framework with ecological roles, the visualization clearly highlights the diversity of functions within each taxonomic group.

Fishy Footprint

In this visualization, I will focus on mapping the ecological roles of the collected fish specimens. By using a map, I aim to analyze ecological patterns across different regions, such as whether certain areas are dominated by predator species or herbivores. Each ecological role will be represented with color-coding, allowing for a clear distinction between roles. This will help identify patterns, such as regions where predators are more common compared to areas with a higher presence of herbivores or omnivores.
